# TOWARDS-EFFICIENT-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-DATA-VALIDATION-SERVICE-IN-EDGE-COMPUTING
Edge computing brings data computation and storage closer to the mobile device to  save response time for decision making. After being processed at the edge, commonly  the data will be uploaded to the cloud for further enriched analysis. For privacy  concerns, local devices may encrypt the collected data before sending it to the cloud  server. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed proposal achieves considerable performance improvements in terms of communication and computation aspects. Particularly, compared to prior work, nearly 123-238 speed up is achieved in our key derivation procedure and the storage cost of the secret key is reduced from 547MB to 1.7MB.
